# Enchantment Disable Tag
This mod provides a tag that you can use to disable enchantments from appearing in your worlds.

This tag can be found at `data/enchantmentdisabletag/tags/enchantment/disabled.json` and can be referenced as `enchantmentdisabletag:disabled`.

## Client or Server?
This mod can operate on the server alone, however, it may be ideal to have it on the client too for a more concrete experience for content such as:
- The Creative Menu will not show disabled enchantments.
- Lang files for the /enchant command disabled error.

## Will this mod delete the enchantments on my item?
Yes, it will. So back up your worlds before disabling an enchantment, and to compensate players who may have grinded for a specific enchantment if you want.
